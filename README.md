# CU-Boulder-MCEN5115-Mechatronics-and-Robotics-Spring2020

My contributions to this project were the entire physical design and manufacturing of the robot, in addition to the Arduino code for homing the turret and translating aiming commands to stepper motor actuation. https://github.com/jackcenter/Police_Academy/tree/master/turretarduino
